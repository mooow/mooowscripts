The scripts in mscripts/ - where the 'm' stays for 'maintenance' - are
meant to be run by root BUT the DON'T do any sort of checks.
I installed them as root:wheel 770

The scripts in uscripts/ - where the 'u' stays for 'utilities' - are
meant to be used by every user. In fact, the don't require any special
permissions, and the operations they perform shouldn't be harmful in any
vay. Thus I installed them as root:wheel 775

This collection has the following dependencies: 
 * python3 (required by remdup)
 * xdg-utils (required by preferred_app2)
 * zsh (required by almost every script in this collection)
 	NB: *maybe* bash could be enough, perhaps with minor changes,
	    anyways I am planning to port every script to perl, in 
	    order to avoid such issues.
 * perl >= 5.10 (required preferred_app2)
 	NB: perl is also required by xdg-utils
It is possible that other dependencies are not included in this list.

== DESCRIPTION ==
A brief description for each script will be added here.
